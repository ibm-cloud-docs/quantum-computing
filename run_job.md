# Run a job
{: #run_job}

This tutorial walks you through the steps to use a program to run a job on an IBM Quantum computer and return the job status.
{: shortdesc}

The [new IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/){: external} interface has been released in early access mode.  It is recommended that you start using that interface to work with IBM Quantum services. Because it is built on IBM Cloud, migration is straightforward.  See the [migration guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/migration-guides/classic-iqp-to-cloud-iqp){: external} for details.
{: attention}

## Before you begin
{: #run-program-byb}

You need a circuit to submit to the program. To learn how to create circuits by using Qiskit, see the [Map problem to quantum circuits and operators guide.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/map-problem-to-circuits){: external}


## Run the job
{: #run-job-step}
{: step}


You will use the Qiskit Runtime QiskitRuntimeService.run() method, which takes the following parameters:

- program_id: ID of the program to run.
- inputs: Program input parameters. These input values are passed to the runtime program and depend on the parameters that are defined for the program.
- options: Runtime options. These options control the execution environment. Currently, the only available option is backend_name, which is optional.
- result_decoder: Optional class used to decode the job result.

In the following example, we submit a circuit to the Sampler program:

```Python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

bell = QuantumCircuit(2)
bell.h(0)
bell.cx(0, 1)
bell.measure_all()

# Execute the Bell circuit
backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
sampler = Sampler(backend=backend)
job = sampler.run([(bell,)])
result = job.result()

pub_result = result[0]
# Get counts from the classical register "meas".
print(f" >> Counts for the meas output register: {pub_result.data.meas.get_counts()}")
```
{: codeblock}

Alternatively, you can use the [Run a job API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#create-job){: external}; optionally use [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/create_job){: external}. You must specify the program ID and the backend to run on, and can optionally supply parameters. Note the job ID that is returned. You need this information to check the status and view results.

To ensure fairness, a maximum execution time for each Qiskit Runtime job exists. If a job exceeds this time limit, it is forcibly ended. The maximum execution time is the smaller of 1) the QPU limit and 2) the `max_execution_time` defined by the program. The execution time limit is three hours for simulator jobs and eight hours for jobs that are running on a physical QPU.
{: note}

The above example submits one simple job, but you can submit multiple jobs as a batch or you can use sessions to submit multiple iterative jobs.  For information, refer to the [Execution modes](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/execution-modes){: external} documentation.

## (Optional) Return the job status
{: #return-status}
{: step}

Follow up the Qiskit Runtime `QiskitRuntimeService.run()` method by running a `RuntimeJobV2` method. The `run()` method returns a RuntimeJob instance, which represents the asynchronous execution instance of the program. The `RuntimeJobV2` class inherits from `BasePrimitiveJob`. The `status()` method of this class returns a string instead of a JobStatus enum that was previously returned. See the [RuntimeJobV2 API reference](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeJobV2){: external} for details.

Several RuntimeJob methods exist, including `job.status()`:

```Python
# check the job status
print(f"Job {job.job_id()} status: {job.status()}")
```
{: codeblock}


Alternatively, run the [List job details API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-details-jid){: external}, manually or by using [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_details_jid){: external} to check the job's status.
