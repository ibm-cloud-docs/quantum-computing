# Qiskit Runtime plans
{: #plans}

The Qiskit Runtime service offers  a Standard Plan for running jobs on quantum hardware.
{: shortdesc}

## Standard plan
{: #standard-plan}

A pay-as-you-go plan for accessing IBM QPUs and simulators. Build your own programs and access all the benefits of Qiskit Runtime by running on real quantum hardware.

## Pricing overview
{: #pricing-overview}

The Standard plan charges you per *Qiskit Runtime second* when running on physical QPUs. The following diagram illustrates what is included in job execution usage. Any time spent waiting for results or in the queue for the quantum computer are excluded.

![Everything before the program starts (such as queuing) is free. After the job starts, it costs $1.60 per second.](images/Runtime_Accounting_Diagram.svg "Runtime second accounting"){: caption="Runtime second accounting" caption-side="bottom"}

Job execution time is the amount of time that the QPU is dedicated to processing your job.
