# View final job results
{: #results}

This tutorial describes how to review final results after running a job.
{: shortdesc}

The [new IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/){: external} interface has been released in early access mode.  It is recommended that you start using that interface to work with IBM Quantum services. Because it is built on IBM Cloud, migration is straightforward.  See the [migration guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/migration-guides/classic-iqp-to-cloud-iqp){: external} for details.
{: attention}

The job's data will be deleted after 30 days.
{: important}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-results}

Run your job and note the job ID.

## Check the status
{: #check-job-status-before-results}

After the job completes, you can view the results.

Immediately after running the job, follow up the {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} QiskitRuntimeService.run() method by running `job.status()`.

If you ran other jobs since running the job you want to investigate, run `job = service.job(job_id)` then run `job.status()`.

Jobs are also listed on the Jobs page for your quantum service instance. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console quantum [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances){: external}, click the name of your instance, then click the Jobs tab. To see the status of your job, click the refresh arrow in the upper right corner.

You can optionally run the [List job details API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-details-jid){: external}, manually or by using [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_details_jid){: external} to check the job's status.

## View the results
{: #view-results}

Follow up the {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} QiskitRuntimeService.run() method by running `job.result()`.

After the job completes, you can click the job on the Jobs page to view the result.

Alternatively, run the [list job results API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-results-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_results_jid){: external}).
