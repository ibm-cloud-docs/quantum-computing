# Auditing events for Quantum Computing
{: #at_events}



As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with the Quantum Computing service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).










## List of data events
{: #at_actions_data}

The following table lists the quantum computing actions that generate an event:

| Action                           | Description                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `quantum-computing.program.create` | An event is generated a program is uploaded.     |
| `quantum-computing.program.read` | An event is generated when program information is returned.  For example, when you list programs or program details.     |
| `quantum-computing.program.delete` | An event is generated when a program is deleted.     |
| `quantum-computing.program.update` | An event is generated when a program metadata is updated.     |
| `quantum-computing.job.create` | An event is generated when a job is started.     |
| `quantum-computing.job.read` | An event is generated when job information is returned. This includes listing jobs, job details, job results, job interim results, or job logs.      |
| `quantum-computing.job.delete` | An event is generated when a job is deleted.     |
| `quantum-computing.job.cancel` | An event is generated when a job is cancelled.     |

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}





Events are available in the **Frankfurt** location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the `eu-de` location. For more information, see [Launching the UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch){: external}.




Events that are generated by an instance of the _YourServiceName_ service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch){: external}.
