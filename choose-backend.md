# Choose a QPU or simulator
{: #choose-backend}

Before you run a job, you must choose a physical QPU (quantum processing unit) or a simulator to run on. Alternatively, you can use [Qiskit Runtime local testing mode.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/local-testing-mode){: external} to run jobs on your local computer.
{: shortdesc}

To find your available QPUs and cloud simulators, view the [Compute resources page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/resources){: external}. You must be logged in to see your available compute resources. 

You can also view your available QPUs and simulators by using the [List your backends](/apidocs/quantum-computing#list-backends){: external} API directly or in [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Programs/list-backends){: external}.
